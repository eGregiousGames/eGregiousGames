Hello, my name's Greg, and I am the solo developer of eGregious Games! I also run a YouTube channel where I talk about games.

I'm currently using Unity to create a top-down Metroidvania/Zelda-like with town management and life sim elements, code-named Frontier!

I consider myself a game designer first and foremost, though I also handle the coding side of things.

I participate in game jams from time to time!
